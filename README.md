## Description

screenGrab can be used with Inventor to simplify image capture of the entire Inventor application window, the graphics view of documents open within Inventor, or parts of the graphics screen.

You can also remap the background to white and the foreground to black, and convert the entire image to grey scale, as well as sending the captured image directly to a printer.
